# Staging repo for models I need to use

Title is self-explanatory.

Parts:
* onnx_models -- contains saved onnx versions of things I train in here
* train_scripts -- training scripts
* torch_models -- saved pytorch state dictionaries
* models -- pytorch model architectures
* dataset_utils -- you'll find some useful things in here maybe
* quantize.py -- implements intel neural compressor quantization
* onnx_utils -- stuff like measuring onnx model accuracy here
